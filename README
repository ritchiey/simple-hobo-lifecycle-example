== Simple Hobo Lifecycle demo

This project is a simple example of using Hobo's lifecycle feature.

Unfortunately, at present, it seems that the lifecycle routes aren't being created properly which means that the <lifecycle-button /> tag creates a form that won't submit without error.              

Using:

  - Hobo 0.8.7
  - Rails 2.3.2
  - Ruby 1.8.6           

This has now been fixed in edge Hobo: https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324/tickets/446-transition-buttons-dont-work#ticket-446-3
